## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- FiveM Server
- Modora Dashboard account
- Access to your Discord server with Modora bot installed

### Step 1: Download & Install

1. Download or clone this resource
2. Place the resource folder in your FiveM server's `resources` directory
3. Add to your `server.cfg`:
   ```cfg
   ensure modora-reports
   ```

**Note:** Screenshot functionality has been disabled. Use file upload instead to add screenshots to reports.

### Step 2: Configure Report Form URL

Edit `config.lua` and set the Report Form URL:

```lua
Config.ReportFormURL = 'https://modora.xyz/fivem/{guildId}/reports/{uniqueId}'
```

**How to get your Report Form URL:**

1. Go to your Modora Dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Guild Settings > FiveM Integration**
3. Add a new server or select existing server
4. Copy the **Report Form URL** from the server settings page
5. Paste it in `config.lua` replacing the placeholders

**Example:**
```lua
Config.ReportFormURL = 'https://modora.xyz/fivem/123456789/reports/abc123def456'
```

**Important:** Make sure to replace `{guildId}` and `{uniqueId}` with actual values from your dashboard, or use the complete URL provided in the dashboard.

### Step 3: Configure Additional Settings

Edit `config.lua` to customize:

```lua
Config.ReportCommand = 'report'        -- Command name
Config.ReportKeybind = 'F7'            -- Keybind (or false to disable)
Config.NearbyRadius = 30.0             -- Radius in meters for nearby players
Config.MaxNearbyPlayers = 5            -- Maximum number of nearby players to show
Config.Locale = 'nl'                   -- Language: 'nl' or 'en'
Config.Debug = false                   -- Set to true for detailed logging
```

### Step 4: Restart Resource

```
restart modora-reports
```

## 📖 Usage

### For Players

1. Type `/report` in chat or press `F7` (default keybind)
2. The report form opens as an iframe modal menu
3. Fill in the custom report form (configured in dashboard)
4. Select category, priority, and fill in custom fields
5. Upload files/attachments if needed (use file upload, not screenshot)
6. Click "Submit Report"
7. Report is automatically created as a Discord ticket
8. You'll receive confirmation with the ticket number in-game

### For Server Owners

1. **Configure Report Form in Dashboard:**
   - Go to: **Guild Settings > FiveM Integration > [Your Server]**
   - Use the **Report Form Builder** to create custom categories and questions
   - Assign ticket panels to specific categories for routing to staff teams
   - Configure file upload settings (max file size, allowed types)
   - Add intro text to display above the form

2. **Configure Channel Name Template:**
   - In the server settings, set a custom channel name template
   - Available placeholders: `{ticket_number}`, `{subject}`, `{reporter_name}`
   - Example: `report-{ticket_number}` or `{subject}-{ticket_number}`

3. **Reports appear in your Discord ticket system:**
   - All player information (identifiers, position, etc.) is included
   - Custom form fields are displayed in a second embed
   - Attachments are uploaded to Modora CDN and sent to Discord
   - Staff can respond in Discord tickets

## 🔧 How It Works

The resource uses an iframe-based approach:

1. **Report Form URL**: The form is hosted on Modora Dashboard and loaded via iframe
2. **Player Data Sync**: Player information (identifiers, position, nearby players) is automatically sent to the iframe via postMessage API
3. **Form Submission**: The form submits directly to Modora Dashboard API
4. **Ticket Creation**: Reports are automatically created as Discord tickets in the configured panel
5. **File Uploads**: Attachments are uploaded to Modora CDN and sent to Discord

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Resource won't start

- Check `fxmanifest.lua` syntax

- Check firewall allows outbound connections on port 443 (HTTPS)
- Enable `Config.Debug = true` for detailed logs

### Invalid Report Form URL

- Make sure you replaced `{guildId}` and `{uniqueId}` with actual values
- Or use the complete URL from your dashboard server settings

- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters

### Reports not submitting

- Check server console for errors
